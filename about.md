## Quick About Myself

I am a Computer Science major senior. Aside from learning more about open source projects (please see blog post #1), my other interests are video game software development, gpu programming (CUDA), desktop GUI development, and web app development (nodejs, django, twisted, AngularJS, React). I would love to talk about any of these things no matter what your experiences are with them (if you are much more vested in these subjects I would love to know about your experiences if you would like to spend that time). Oh also I have a bachelor's in Accounting, but I didn't end up enjoying the work hence I am now a Computer Science major (much more fulfilling, interesting work).

### Details

About my code experience. I am quite familiar with the python programming/scripting language, several years of creating scripts, desktop applications, wrappers, and a few cross language tools (Cython, C extensions). I enjoy discussing the python architecture and learning new ways to program. I mainly operate on Windows operating systems although I am also familiar with Linux (Red Hat OS, Ubuntu). Other languages I use but am not as familiar with are C#, C++, and Ruby. Generally I find that OOP languages are very similar to me and it is easy to move from one to other although, learning the syntax and googling syntax and ways to do certain things consumes most of the time spent switching between languages.

For GUI development, I have used frameworks in python such as Tkinter, wx Widgets, and Qt4/Qt5 frameworks. My favorite and most experience with are the Qt frameworks. I have used the C++ version of the Qt frameworks as well, and generally find that development is faster on python and there is no siginificant decrease in responsiveness even with the webkit modules, thus I prefer the python version of the frameworks. Although, it is much easier to integrate libraries not easily exported to python than to attempt to integrate them back into python.

For game development, I have experience using the Unity3D game engine and it's subset of Mono (C#). I don't have much experience with asset creation but I do know how 3d models are made (all the steps of the pipeline), shaders (not much experience with creating them yet as it is game engine specific), game states and state machines, animator compoments, networking (third party frameworks) and much more.

About Web development, I have created a few sites over the years (that I don't currently operate or operate under NDA) from simple Wordpress sites, to what I create now which are full stack websites with databases, queues for long running tasks, responsive dynamic frontends.

Finally, I also have a decent working knowledge of databases from MySQL, MariaDB, Postgress, and MongoDb (SQL and noSQL databases).

### Other
